#  BMI Calculator

## Project Description

This project involves the development of a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator application, designed using Apple's UIKit framework and developed in Swift, adhering to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The objective of this application is to provide a user-friendly and interactive interface for users to calculate their BMI, an important measure of health based on an individual's height and weight.

## Key Features

1. **User Interface:** Developed using UIKit, the application boasts an intuitive and responsive interface. It ensures compatibility with various iOS devices, providing a seamless user experience.

2. **MVC Architecture:** The application strictly follows the MVC design pattern, promoting organized code structure and efficient data handling. This pattern enables easy maintenance and scalability of the app.

3. **Swift Programming:** Leveraging Swift’s powerful features, the app ensures fast performance and a high level of security. Swift’s syntax and language features are utilized to create a robust and efficient application.

4. **BMI Calculation:** Users can input their height and weight, and the app calculates their BMI. The calculation logic is encapsulated in the Model component, adhering to the MVC principles.
